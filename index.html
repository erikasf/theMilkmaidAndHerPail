      <p>Patty the Milkmaid was going to market carrying her milk in a
          Pail on her head.  As she went along she began calculating what
          she would do with the money she would get for the milk.  "I'll buy
          some fowls from Farmer Brown," said she, "and they will lay eggs
          each morning, which I will sell to the parson's wife. 
          With the money that I get from the sale of these eggs I'll buy myself a new
          dimity frock and a chip hat; and when I go to market, won't all

          jealous; but I don't care. <br> I shall just look at her and toss my
          head like this.  As she spoke she tossed her head back, the Pail
          fell off it, and all the milk was spilt.  So she had to go home
          and tell her mother what had occurred."Ah, my child," said the mother,</p>
